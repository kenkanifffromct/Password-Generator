# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Goal
The purpose of this was to create a simple(to the user, not the coder in training, believe me) password generator that's created based on the criteria the user chooses to include. This is achieved through functions, statements, prompts, alerts, etc...

Parameters are set to give the password a minimum and maximum length.

Big shoutout to [Jason Gibson](https://github.com/jgibsone4)! I could not have gotten this done without his help and patience.
